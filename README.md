Password Manager - OT

This is my most recent summer project. I chose an encryption project as I thought it would be good to learn sensitive data handling & encryption.
I spent a lot of time researching salt and encryption. You'll need to understand these to follow the code.

Important Info:
1 - I did a lot of additional learning to understand salt and the encryption process, you must understand it to understand the code
2 - Password = AdminPassword123 - delete the password file and run "masterPassSetup.py" to create your password (WRITE IT DOWN)
3 - Encryption key.key file best stored on a secure server or portable drive

Additional features will be added to this project as I learn more in my classes and from what I research at home.
Any bugs/ issues or ways you think I could make the code more secure or efficient, please feel free to send me a message.

Have fun :)
